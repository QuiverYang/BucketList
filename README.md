## Additional Information
Our idea is inspiring from COVID-19. It has taken thousands of people's lives worldwide in such a short time. Such bad things can always happen without any warning. Moreover, the lifespan of the human being is not quite long. Therefore, we should dedicate ourselves to the goals that we genuinely concerned. PlannerX is aiming to assist people to focus on primary goals. Invest our most valuable property, which is time, on the right thing instead of wasting it on boring, meaningless activities.
